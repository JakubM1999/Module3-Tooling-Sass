        <div class="card-child"> <h2>What is Sass?</h2>Sass or in other words Super CSS is a 
            CSS pre-processor. We could also say that it is exstension to CSS, mainly
             used by people to save time since it reduces repetition of CSS

        </div>
        <div class="card-child"> <h2>But why use Sass?</h2>Stylesheets are getting larger,
             more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a Sass can help. I mean
             imagine to write 2000 lines in single stylesheet. Sass lets you use many features that CSS doesn't have, like nested rules,
             mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.
        </div>
        <div class="card-child"> <h2>How does it work?</h2> A browser does not understand Sass code
            so you will need some kind of Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into
            standard CSS. This process is called transpiling. So when you write a Sass code the program that
            is transpiling for you will automaticly make a CSS code back. These programs are usually node.js and gulp.
