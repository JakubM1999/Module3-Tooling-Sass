So I made a github repository and a basic website that should explain well what there was to understand in knolage and also the skills that had to be learned. I am confident that I understand what Sass is and that I learned tooling Sass. IÂ´ll also leaved link to live site so you can see it but the repository should be enough. Hope you like it :)
