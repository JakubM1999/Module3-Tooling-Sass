So I made a github repository and a basic website for this assignment that should explain well what there was to understand in knowledge and also the skills that had to be learned. I am confident that I understand what Sass is and that I learned tooling and useing Sass. IÂ´ll also leaved link to live site so you can see it but the repository should be enough. Hope you like it :) P.s I didn't much care about the looks of this website since this assignment was focusing more on learning what Sass is and how to use it.
